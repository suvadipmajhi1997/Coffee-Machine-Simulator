## Introduction - 
This is a Java console application that simulates a coffee machine. 
It allows users to buy different types of coffee, refill the ingredients, take money from the machine, and view the current ingredient levels. 
Additionally, it provides analytics on the number of coffees sold, total earnings, and ingredient consumption.

## Features - 
The Coffee Machine Simulator supports the following features:

* Buy Coffee: Users can choose from different types of coffee (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino) and purchase them. 
The coffee will only be dispensed if there are enough ingredients in the machine.

* Fill Ingredients: The maintainer can refill the coffee machine with water, milk, and coffee beans. 
The amounts are specified by the user.

* Take Money: The maintainer can collect the money from tSELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral: It\'s a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.'
    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles: It\'s a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.'
    WHEN A + B <= C OR B + C <= A OR A + C <= B THEN 'Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don\'t form a triangle.'
    ELSE 'Scalene: It\'s a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.'
  END AS TriangleType
FROM TRIANGLES;
he machine's money box.

* Show Ingredients: Users can check the current levels of water, milk, coffee beans, and the amount of money in the machine.

* Analytics: The machine provides analytics on the number of coffees sold, total earnings, and ingredient consumption.

* Exit: Users can choose to exit the simulation.

## Usage
* Run the Coffee Machine Simulator program.

* You will be prompted with a list of actions: buy, fill, take, show, analytics, exit.
* Select an action by typing the corresponding keyword and pressing Enter.

  * buy: Choose a type of coffee to buy. You will be prompted to enter the number corresponding to the coffee you want to purchase.

  * fill: Enter the amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans to refill the coffee machine.

  * take: Collect the money from the machine's money box.

  * show: View the current levels of water, milk, coffee beans, and the amount of money in the machine.

  * analytics: Display analytics on the number of coffees sold, total earnings, and ingredient consumption.

  * exit: Terminate the simulation.

* Follow the prompts and instructions provided by the program.

* Repeat steps 3-4 until you choose to exit the simulation.

## Requirements
To run the Coffee Machine Simulator, you need to have the following:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
* A Java compiler to compile the source code.
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute the compiled code.
